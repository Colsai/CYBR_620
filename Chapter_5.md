# Cryptography
## Chapter 5

Encryption and crypytography:
- Cryptography is the science of encrypting information
- Cypers are complicated algorithms for concealing information
- Plaintext is protected from authorized encryption with ciphertext
- An algorithm and a key are used. 

### More...
- Cryptanalysis is the process of analyzing information in an attempt to return the encrypted message to its original form.
- Differential cryptanalysis, which compares input and output to try to determine key used.
- Linear cryptanalysis, which compares

Cryptography is more than encryption: data protection, data hiding, integrity checks, nonrepudiation attacks, policy enforcement, key management and exchange.
