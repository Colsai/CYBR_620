# CYBERSECURITY NOTES
## Chapter 10

## Routers 
Can come with a lot of internal functions, need to be protected from hackers, because it can give them a lot of control.

## Firewalls
- Firewalls are network devices, software, or a combination of them to set a security policy.
- Heart of a firewall is the security policies involved.
- Traffic should be more sanitized when using a firewall.
- Many different types of firewalls 
- May have multiple firewalls, the topology determines what networks are employed at what parts.
- Perfect firewall policy is one that the end user never sees even a single unauthorized packet enter. 

## How firewalls work... 
- Firewalls work by establishing security policys and enforcing them: Network address translation, basic packet filtering, stateful packet filtering, access control lists, application layer proxies.
- ACLs (access control lists) are a cornerstone of security.
- Firewalls can also act as network traffic regulators
- Firewalls can examine inbound email and determine if it is safe, etc.

## Next generation firewalls
- Deep packet inspection
- Move beyond port/protocol inspection and blocking
- Add application-level inspection
- Add intrusion prevention
- Bring intelligence from outside the firewall

Traffic can be managed based on content, not merely site or URL.
