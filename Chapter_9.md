### Vocabulary
- Address Resolution Protocol: A protocol in the TCP/IP suite certification used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses
- Bus Topology: A network layout in which a common line connects devices
- Datagram: A packet of data that can be transmitted over a packet-switched system in a connectionless mode.
- Denial-of-Service (DoS)- An attack in which actions are taken to deprive authorized individuals from accessing a system.
- DNS: An attack in which actions are taken to dewprive individuals from accessing a system, it affects resources, data, or the network
- DMZ: Demilitarized zone, the zone between the internet and the network, semi-protected
- DHCP: An internet engineering task force internet protocol specification for automatically allocating IP addresses and other configuration information based on network adapter addresses

## Introduction:
A network is a means to cnnect together two or more computers to share information. This term has different meanings, depending on context, but generally defined in terms of architecture, toplogy, and protocol. Sizes can vary.
- LAN: Typically smaller in size and coverage, consists of two or more connected devices. Office buildings, or home networks.
- WAN: Tends to be larger, and consists of two or more systems in geographically separated areas. Corporate networks connecting offices.
- They are connected by leased lines, radio waves, satellite relays, microwaves, and dial up connections. 
Companies have multiple lans that connect to a wan that provides intercompany connectivity. 

### Other types:
CAN (campus area networks), which connect buildings, intranet: private networks only for authorized individuals wtihin and organization, internet, the global network connecting hundreds of millions of systems/users, Metro area networks- designed to connect a specific locality, storage area networks- high speed networks connecting a variety of storage devices such as tape/raid/optical file servers/etc., VLAN- virtual lans, which provide logical networking of systems across different networks to act like a LAN, client/server- a network with a powerful system (server) to provide resources to clients, peer-to-peer: a network in which all entities are equal

### Network Topology
Topology is how a network is physically or logically arranged. There are a few classes of network topologies- star (connects to a central point), bus (connected to the same cable), ring (connected via a closed loop), mixed (more than one topology in use). 
Larger networks, such as those inside office complexes, often use more than one topology, such as a ring topology that connects all buildings in a complex, with interconnected star topologies on each floor.

### Network Protocols
When engineers started to connect computers together via networks, tehy realized they needed a common method of communication, or protocol (HTTP)
These are agreed-upon formats for transmitting data between systems. They are agreed-upon parameters, error checking, and mechanisms for systems to signal when they are finished receiving/transmitting data. Most networks are dominated by ethernet and internet control.

### Example protocols
- Appletalk: Connectted Mac computers and printers
- ATM (Asyncrhonous Transfer Mode): Based on transferring data in fixed-size packets, the fixed packet sizes helped ensure that no single data type monopolized bandwidth.
- Ethernet: The LAN protocol developed jointly by Xerox, DEC, and intel, most widely implemented LAN standard
- Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), protocl for sending digital data over fiber-optica cabling
- Internet Protocls (IP): Protocls for managing and transmitting data between packet-switched computer networks, originally developed for DOD. Most users are familiar with IP for email, FTP, telnet, and HTTP.
