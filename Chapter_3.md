###
POLICIES: High-level, broad statements of what the organization wishes to accomplish
PROCEDURES: Step-by-step instructions on how to do it (how to act in situation X, etc.)
STANDARDS: Mandatory elements regarding the implementation of a policy, can be externally-driven
GUIDELINES: Recommendations relating to a policy, not mandatory steps

LIFECYCLE: PLAN, IMPLEMENT, MONITOR, EVALUATE
Vulvernability Assessment- attempt to identify and prioritize list of vulnerabilities, penetration test- method to check the security of a system by 
simulating an attack by a malciious individual to ensure security is accurate. 

Security Policy- High level statement produced by senior management that outlines what security means, main policy, and should include other policies in change management, data
HR policies, etc.
Change management ensures proper procedures are followed when modifications to IT infrastructure are made.
Management implies process is controlled in some systemic way, it includes request of change, review and approval of the process, examining consequences,
implementing change, and documenting the process.

## DATA POLICIES
Who owns the data? Data requires an owner; data ownership is a business function. Not all data requires same handling, but these characteristics must be defined.
It is important to ensure no unauthorized data sharing. 
Data backup requirements involve determining level of backup, restoring objectives, and level of protection requirements
Data classification requires data labeling, so that personnel can know if it is sensitive and what level of protection is needed. 
Need to know/Least Privledge, absolute minimum amt of information provided, as well as who can grant info/assign privledges
Data should be fully destroyed, shredded, etc. Security should be considered in all employee circumstances. 

## HR POLICIES
Humans are weakest links, policies needed for hiring, disgruntled, and leaving employees; on-boarding, and off-boarding. 
Code of ethics that demand honesty and professionalism, as well as principles of privacy and confidentiality.
Hiring should incorporate reviews, status changes. Retirement, separation, and termination of employees should also be considered.
Mandatory vacations are a good idea as they can stop issues such as fraud or embezzlement, and may give the employer the ability to detect issues. 
Social networking policies are also important.

AUP outlines what is acceptable for employees to use or view, limits liability and should clearly delineate activities not allowed.
Email usage policies are one example. 
Clean desk policy- employees shouldn't leave out their password or sensitive information, since it can be compromised. 
BYOD policy- to lower the risk associated with connecting a wide array of devices to the network.


## Diligence
Due diligence is an application of a specific standard of care, due care is the degree of care that ordinary people exercise.
Our expectation of due care is that every employee reset their password during a data breech .
Due process is concerned with fairness, justice, and liberty- procedural process. Were all the employee's rights protected?
Incident response policy- developed outline of associated procedures for incident, including preparation, detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and follow-up.
Security training and awareness programs can improve org posture, and make them aware of possible issues. Seminars, videos, posters, newsletters, etc. 
This lso includes training with respect to complex tasks- referesher training can be helpfu lfor this. Think second-level policies that dictate some of this. 
Training should also include role-based training, that targets their responsibilities and roles. 

Additionally, orgs must comply with laws, best practices, and standards, such as HIPAA.

User habits can improve security- such as ensuring employees lock doors, don't leave unsecured information, secure storage media, shred paper, don't divulge sensitive info,
protect laptops and other mobile devices. 

## New Threats 
New viruses are created everyday-- and it is important for an org to prevent against phishing attacks, social networking, and p2p. Manage risk.
Records should measure compliance dates and effectiveness of training.

## Agrements
Interoperability agreements- Many business operations involve actions between differerent parties, which require communication between parties. These should be codified and documented. 
Service Level Agreements (SLA) are contractual agreements between entities that describe specified levels of service that servicing entities agree to guarantee for a customer.
SLA rules describe the entire set of product or service functions in sufficient detail that their requirement will be unambiguous. 
Business Partnership agreements are legal agreements between partners on expectations of the relationship between partners
The Uniform partnership act (UPA) lays out a uniform set of rules associated with partnerships to resolve any partnership terms, "one size fits all"
MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) are legal documents used to describe a bilateral agreement between parties. They express a set of intended actions between parties with respect to a common pursuit or goal, more formal than a handshake. 
ISAs (Interconnection security agreement) are specialized agreements between organizations that have interconnected IT systems. ISA are part of MOU.

## Security Perimeter
Various network components- connection to internet, intrusion detection system, router.
The security perimenter also can have possible access points such as PSTN (telephone network) or wireless acess points, modems, VOIP, etc.

However, insiders are the biggest threat- employees who have physical access and enough information can be very dangerous. 

## Physical Security
Physical security is all mechanisms of physical access to computer systems and networks restricted to only authorized users.
Things like doors and windows, floors and ceilings, etc.
We can restrict physical access by requiring individuals to authenticate with something they have, know, or are.
Locks are a common physical have or know, but video surveillance, access logs, and guards are other methods of security. 
Biometrics are something you are, and can be more sophisticated and expensive, but can suffer from false positives and false negatives. Examples- handwriting analysis, retinal/iris scans, voiceprints, hand geometry, facial geometry, fingerprints, etc. 
Physical barriers (such as walls or even open space), can serve as layered security. Man traps are small spaces for only one person at a time, between locking doors. 
HVAC is an important component of security because of computers generate a lot of heat. This can also include continuous power supply, etc. 
Fire suppression is also an aspect of security, since fires can easily destroy computing equipment- gas and water based systems.
Wireless comms, made up of the phones, their base systems, and the hardware and software, and bluetooth/wireless internet all come with security issues.
Van eck phenomena, where electromagnetic interference can be picked up, can show what is being displayed on a monitor. TEMPEST detected this. Shielding and proximity can prevent this.
Other modern eavesdropping can happen on webcams, microphones, keyloggers, etc.
