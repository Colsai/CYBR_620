# Cybersecurity Class 1 (Rao)
## Chapter 1
## 1/31/22

## Principles of Computer Security, Fourth Edition
- People are not thinking about the current issues surrounding protections. 
- On the black market, credit cards are very cheap ($10-$50).
- Ransomware is the most profitable way to profit.

*As criminals have become more sophisiticated, they have been able to monetize more and more attacks*

- Computer security is not a simple concept to define... computer and information security
- Historical incidents and crime.... more and more organized events of cybercrime have entered the picture.

**From 2009, many threats to Security- many recent attacks.**

Unlike a connected attack...

- If one of us committed a regular crime, there is likely a lot of evidence (murders, etc.) However, in a cyberattack, attribution is very difficult. 
- It is very difficult to prove that someone has committed a cyber attack. The forensices are not at a level that people will know. It takes a lot of effort to pinpoint the source. 
- This class is more on a defensive side.
- Cyber offense is much more difficult than cyber defense. 
- It is very easy to break a wifi password.

## Chapter 2

### Nation-States, Terrorists, and Information Warfare
- Critical infrastructures are vulnerable to cyberattack (electricity, water, etc.)
- This is a major area of concern for the US government.

## Security Trends 
- Computer Security
- Network Security
- Information Security and Information Assurance

## Security Basics (Continued)
- Cybersecurity is the term used to describe the field covering availability of the systems and information when we want them.
- COMSEC (Communications Security) deals with the security of telecommunications systems.
- Cybersecuirty is a regular topic in headline news.
- Led to terms hacking, virus, TCP/IP, encryption, and firewalls in casual conversations.

### **C**onfidentiality
Ensures that only indivudals have the authority to view a piece of information.

### **I**ntegrity
Deals with the generation and modification of data. Only authorized individuals should ever be able to create or change/delete information.
Do we trust who we say we are?

### **A**vailability
Ensures that the data is available to use when the authorized user wants it. 

**The cornerstone of cybersecurity**

### Two additional CIA security goals
- Authentication attempts to ensure that an individual is who they claim to be.
- Nonrepudiation deals with the ability to verify that a message has been sent and received and the sender can be identified and verified.

### Recent Emphasis on Systems Assurance
- Auditability referes to whether a control can be verified to be functioned properly. 

### Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity
- It provides a common taxonomy and mechanism to assist in aligning management practices with existing standards, guidelines, and practices.
- Its purpose is to complement and enhance risk management efforts.
- It is composed of five core functions: identify, protect, detect, respond, and record.
- Tiers represent the organization's ability from Partial (T1) to Adaptive (T4).
