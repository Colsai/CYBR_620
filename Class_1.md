## Principles of Computer Security, Fourth Edition
- People are not thinking about the current issues surrounding protections. 
- On the black market, credit cards are very cheap ($10-$50).
- Ransomware is the most profitable way to profit.

*As criminals have become more sophisiticated, they have been able to monetize more and more attacks*

- Computer security is not a simple concept to define... computer and information security
- Historical incidents and crime.... more and more organized events of cybercrime have entered the picture.

From 2009
Threats to Security- many recent attacks.
Unlike a connected attack...

- If one of us committed a regular crime, there is likely a lot of evidence (murders, etc.) However, in a cyberattack, attribution is very difficult. 
- It is very difficult to prove that someone has committed a cyber attack. The forensices are not at a level that people will know. It takes a lot of effort to pinpoint the source. 
- This class is more on a defensive side.
- Cyber offense is much more difficult than cyber defense. 
- It is very easy to break a wifi password.
