## The Software Engineering Process
- When you get into companies and using cyber skills commercially- make sure you have a seat at the table to check for software requirements, etc.
- Cost/Time Curve is exponential- much easier to add requirements early than later on. 

## 
Confidentiality Availability Integrity
- Waterfall: Multistep process over a year
- Spiral: 
- Agile: As short as a day
Devsecops == Agile

## Evolutionary Model
An iterative model designed to enable the construction of increasingly complex versions of a project. Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) model is integral.

### Secure Development Lifecycle
Secure coding is creating code that does what it is supposed to do, and only what it is supposed to do.

#### Two important tools:
- Understanding attack surface minimization is a strategy to reduce the places where code can be attacked. 
- Threat modeling: analyzing threats and their potential effects on software in a very finely detailed fashion.
